# **Avant-Garde**

This is a website to view, post, and share your favorite artists. A user, once logged in, can create their own artist entry. They can enter a variety of details about their artist, including:
- Artist name
- 5 images of their work (url's)
- Profile pic of the artist
- Date of birth/death
- Movement/era they worked in
- Bio

All these can be edited if the user is logged in. Also, a user can delete artist entries. Non-users can see this info, but can't edit/delete entries. Users can sign-in/sign-up with their Google account.
